This is a test to see how adding a remote branch works.
I made this text file on 'master', and I am going to push it as a new remote branch.
I will run:
git branch -u origin/remote_branch_test

I will report the results here.
It did not work, it said that origin/remote_test_branch did not exist.

The following should work however:
1. Make new branch locally
	a. git checkout -b remote_branch_test
2. Push local branch to remote
	a. git push origin remote_branch_test
